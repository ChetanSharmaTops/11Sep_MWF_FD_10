    <h1>Promises in JS</h1>
    <p>
      The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an
      asynchronous operation and its resulting value
    </p>

    <li><em> pending: </em>initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
    <li>
      <em> fulfilled:</em> meaning that the operation was completed
      successfully.
    </li>
    <li><em> rejected:</em> meaning that the operation failed.</li>

    <script>
      const mypromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let x = 10;
        let y = 10;
        if (x == y) {
          setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Task Fulfiiled");
          }, 2000);
        } else {
          setTimeout(() => {
            reject("Task Failed");
          }, 2000);
        }
      });

      console.log(mypromise);

      mypromise.then(
        (result) => console.log(result),
        (error) => console.log(error)
      );
    </script>
